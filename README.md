Electric Vehicle Recharge Bunk Slot Booking System
Project Title
Electric Vehicle Recharge Bunk

Problem Statement
With the rapid integration of Electric Vehicles (EVs) into transportation systems, efficient charging infrastructure is paramount. This project addresses the challenge of long queues and inefficient access to EV charging stations by proposing an EV Charging Slot Booking System. The system aims to provide EV car owners with the convenience of discovering charging stations, checking real-time slot availability, receiving charging status updates, and booking slots in advance. This will enhance EV accessibility and ensure seamless long-distance travel.

Technologies Used
Frontend:

HTML5: For structuring the web content.

CSS3: For styling and ensuring a responsive, user-friendly interface.

JavaScript (ES6+): For client-side logic, user interactions, and dynamic content updates.

Backend & Database:

Firebase Authentication: For secure user registration, login, and session management.

Cloud Firestore: A NoSQL cloud database used for storing user profiles (with roles), EV bunk details, and future slot booking information.

Firebase Hosting: For deploying and serving the web application securely and reliably.

Features & Modules
The application is structured into different modules to cater to various user roles:

1. User Module
User Registration & Login: Securely create an account and log in to access features.

View Live Charging Bunk Information: Browse a list of available EV charging stations.

Search Bunks: Filter charging stations by location (address) and charging type (e.g., CCS, Type 2).

View Bunk Details: See essential information about each charging bunk, including name, address, charging type, contact, and available slots.

(Future: Google Map Location, Book Charging Slots, View Slot Vacancy)

2. EV Admin Module
Admin Registration & Login: Securely create an admin account and log in. (Admin roles are currently assigned manually in Firebase Firestore after registration).

Register Driver Accounts: Admins can register new users specifically as 'driver' roles.

Create EV Bunk Location Details: Add new charging stations to the system, including details like bunk name, address, charging type, contact information, and total number of slots.

(Future: Manage Bunk Details, Manage Recharge Slots)

Project Structure
The project follows a simple, flat file structure for easy management:

ev-charging-app/
├── index.html          # Main application HTML file
├── app.js              # All JavaScript logic for the application
├── style.css           # All CSS styles for the application
├── firebase.json       # Firebase Hosting and Firestore rules configuration
├── .firebaserc         # Firebase project aliases
├── firestore.rules     # Firestore security rules
├── firestore.indexes.json # Firestore index definitions
└── 404.html            # Custom 404 error page (generated by Firebase init)

Setup & Local Execution
To set up and run this project locally:

Clone / Download the Project:

Download the ev-charging-app folder to your local machine.

Firebase Project Setup:

Go to the Firebase Console.

Create a new Firebase project (e.g., ev-charging-app-2025).

Register a Web App within your new Firebase project.

Copy your firebaseConfig object from the Firebase Console (under Project settings -> Your apps -> Web app -> Config).

Paste this firebaseConfig object into the <script type="module"> section of your index.html file, replacing the placeholder values. Ensure the Firebase SDK version matches (currently 12.0.0).

Install Firebase CLI:

If you haven't already, install the Firebase CLI globally:

npm install -g firebase-tools

Log in to Firebase via CLI:

firebase login

Initialize Firebase in Project Directory:

Navigate to your ev-charging-app directory in your terminal:

cd path/to/your/ev-charging-app

Initialize Firebase for the project. Select Firestore and Hosting features. Choose your newly created Firebase project. For the public directory, specify ./. Do NOT configure as a single-page app, and do NOT overwrite index.html.

firebase init

Enable Firebase Services & Configure API Key:

In the Firebase Console for your project:

Go to "Build" > "Authentication" and enable "Email/Password" sign-in method.

Go to "Build" > "Firestore Database" and click "Create database" (start in production mode, select your preferred region).

Go to Google Cloud Console API Credentials.

Find the API key associated with your Firebase web app.

Edit API Key Restrictions:

Under "Application restrictions", select "HTTP referrers (web sites)".

Add the following "Website restrictions":

https://ev-charging-app-2025.web.app/* (replace with your actual Firebase Hosting URL)

https://*.firebaseapp.com/*

http://localhost:8000/*

http://localhost/*

Under "API restrictions", select "Restrict key" and ensure the following APIs are enabled:

Cloud Firestore API

Identity Toolkit API

Firebase Management API

Firebase Installizations API

Google Cloud Storage for Firebase (optional, for future file uploads)

Click "Save".

Update Firestore Security Rules:

In the Firebase Console, go to "Build" > "Firestore Database" > "Rules" tab.

Replace the existing rules with the following (for development purposes, allowing authenticated users to read/write, and anyone to read charging bunks):

rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    match /chargingBunks/{bunkId} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow create, update, delete: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}

Click "Publish".

Run Locally (Optional, for quick testing):

In your terminal, from the ev-charging-app directory:

firebase serve --only hosting

Access your app at http://localhost:5000 (or the port indicated).

Deployment
To deploy the application to Firebase Hosting:

Ensure all your local changes in index.html, app.js, and style.css are saved.

In your terminal, navigate to the ev-charging-app directory.

Execute the deploy command:

firebase deploy --only hosting

After successful deployment, access your live website at the Hosting URL provided in the terminal (e.g., https://ev-charging-app-2025.web.app/).

Always perform an "Empty Cache and Hard Reload" (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R) in your browser after deployment to ensure the latest version is loaded.

Admin Access (Manual Role Assignment):

After registering a user, go to Firebase Console -> Firestore Database -> users collection.

Find the user's document and manually change their role field from user to admin.

Log in with this admin account.

Create EV Bunk (Admin Role):

As an Admin, navigate to the "Admin Panel: Create EV Bunk Location Details" section.

Fill in details like Bunk Name/ID, Location/Address, Charging Type, Contact Info, and Number of Slots.

Click "Create Bunk".

View Bunks (User/Admin/Driver Role):

Log in as any user.

The "Live Charging Bunk Information" section will display all posted charging bunk details.
